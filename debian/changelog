cruft (0.9.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Instead of directly accessing installed maintainer scripts and dpkg "list"
    files, call dpkg-query as appropriate. This makes it much slower in some
    cases but at least it will let us survive the incoming revolution in dpkg
    database (closes: Bug#616068)

cruft (0.9.13) experimental; urgency=high

  * Changed all bash and sh scripts to use dash, because bash makes it hard to
    write reliable scripts - see discussion at
    http://groups.google.com/group/gnu.bash.bug/browse_thread/thread/e37f5c7ddcc55eeb
    (closes: Bug#500261)
    - changed the shebang line
    - added a dependency and a build-dependency on dash
    - fixed a bashism in check_type_symlink and disabled timestamps in $PS4
  * common.sh:
    - disable corefile limit in debug mode
    - added fusectl to list of ignored filesystems (closes: Bug#499783)
  * filter_shell.c:
    - swapped checks in a for loop to avoid rather harmless but technically
      invalid uninitialized memory accesses
    - increase the number of patterns we can handle to 4000
    - when there are more patterns to load than we can handle then warn and
      exit, instead of segfaulting (closes: Bug#498986)

cruft (0.9.7) experimental; urgency=low

  * The "DebConf 7" release - includes 0.9.6-0.18 (experimental)
  * Taking over the package with aj's permission
    - finally got rid of that ugly version appendix
  * Bumped standards-version to 3.7.2.2
  * Bumped debhelper compat and version dep to 5
  * Added lintian and linda overrides for the non-standard spool directory
    permissions

      stream of data from the explain scripts
    - cruft:
      . moved filtering to after the merge_diff stage
      . only use filters/explain scripts which have a matching package in the
        system OR have UPPER_CASE name (closes: Bug#373708), also only use a
        filter/script once, making it possible to do overrides cleanly
        (closes: Bug#410800)
      . introduced multiple filter directories, making it possible to silence
        any complaints from cruft (closes: Bug#383364)
  * many programs: lots of changes to detect potential output (but not only)
    failures, for example due to filesystem being full. (closes: Bug#411860)

  * Many cleanups and minor enhancements to programs and documentation
  * filter files changes submitted by Jeremy Bygott (closes: Bug#411602)

cruft (0.9.6-0.8) experimental; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload blessed by aj
  * cruft:
    - do not use "/dev/stdout", rather cat to implied stdout. Also chdir to
      original directory before catting to a report file.
    - pass DRIVES information using a file in spool
    - use filter_ignores
  * common.sh: new cruft_find function wrapping around "find", pass DRIVES
    information using a file in spool
  * cruft_find: added new perl script to implement the cruft_find function
  * filter_ignores: added new perl script to filter filenames WRT setting of
    DRIVES and IGNORES (Closes: #47513)
  * common.pl: added new perl library with common perl code
  * explain scripts:
    - dpkg: use find|xargs|cat|sort instead of globbing (Closes: #284711)
    - dpkg: count diversions and file occurences and print filenames correct
      number of times
    - gconf: avoid warning if there are no gconf schema files
    - lost_found: source common.sh before using its functions
    - home_ftp, users: use new common.sh cruft_find function
    - dev: adjusted fs list
  * helper scripts: reimplemented as one Perl script, removed outdated updater
    scripts. They don't contain old non-FHS paths now. (Closes: #126855)
  * filter files: both automatically and manually updated and added some
    scripts (Closes: #133887, #133888)
  * Makefile.in:
    - tweaked not to install .svn metadata
    - really modified to remove shellexp.o in clean rule (last time it must
      have been Makefile, not .in)
    - added cruft_find and common.pl installation

cruft (0.9.6-0.6) experimental; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload blessed by aj
  * Rewritten the README file to clear up the general idea on how cruft works.
  * Moved common code from dash-search and filter_shell to shellexp.c
  * Added some comments to code in various files
  * Added --ignore support to cruft, and made explain files obey that (using
    functions stored in new files common.sh). This allows serious speed
    improvements in certain situations. (Closes: #29187)
  * Updated manpage (Closes: #308176)
  * Added support for running in chroots, by setting DRIVES to / if it turns
    out empty.
  * Added afs to list of ignored filesystems (Closes: #233979)
  * Use dh_installman instead of obsolete dh_installmanpages
  * Removed obsolete dh_suidregister
  * Removed junky postinst "warning" (Closes: #174877, #304440)
  * Removed the "optimization" from dash-search which caused only the first
    file containing matching pattern to be printed. Apparently the purpose of
    dash-search is to find all occurences. Noted in manpage that the file name
    is printed for each line.
  * filters/*: /usr/{doc,man} updated to /usr/share/{doc,man}
  * filters/base-files: added /srv, /media, /usr/local and its subdirs
  * filters/libc6: added /etc/.pwd.lock
  * explain/ca-certificates: new file
  * explain/dev: fixed grep to be quiet
  * explain/dpkg: use a hash to remember diversions instead of an array
  * explain/diversions: only print a diversion target if it exists in
    filesystem
  * explain/gconf: new file: a kludgy way to list at least some of the gconf files
  * explain/tmp: removed, since this was just a copy of explain/dev
  * Removed a misplaced adduser filter file.
  * Noted in changelog that previous upload Closes: #149736 (I know this is
    slight changelog abuse, but I haven't yet learned everything about BTS
    version supoprt)

cruft (0.9.6-0.5) experimental; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload blessed by aj
  * cruft:
    - Use tempfile to make temporary file, which makes -r create reportfile
      "report" (Closes: #182796, #42969)
    - Report broken symlinks themselves, rather than their inexistant
      destinations (Closes: #149736)
    - Ignore /dev/(fd|std(in|out|err)) links (Closes: #146021)
    - Added --chroots which allows to completly broken symlinks in chosen dirs
    - Do not traverse some special filesystems
      (Closes: #272124, #291820, #110000)
    - Improved command line error reporting a little (Closes: #51446)
    - Set LC_COLLATE to C to avoid sorting differences causing double output
      (Closes: #55022, #155431). This should also make sorts faster in non-C locale
      environments.
  * explain files fixes:
     - dev: don't scan it if cruft itself doesn't
     - dpkg, diversions: Treat diversions properly (Closes: #263472):
       . dpkg: don't report files which were diverted to something else
       . diversions: report diversion destinations
     - home_ftp: fixed find command (Closes: #88274)
     - init_d: fixed grep expression for new 'file' output syntax
     - lost_found: added ext3 to list of filesystems
     - users: Users are allowed not to have home dirs and mailboxes. So only
       list mailboxes and homedirs which really exist.
       (Closes: #265794, #50730) Also use /var/mail instead of deprecated
       /var/spool/mail
  * filter files:
     - prime-net: new file: (Closes: #95799)

       libhesiod0, libnet-perl, locales, lpr, modutils, netbase,
       nfs-kernel-server, openssl, php4, popularity-contest, proftpd, tcpd
  * Wrote a manpage for dash-search (Closes: #37735)
  * dash-search: added a matched arguments cache array to speed things up just
    a little bit
  * debian/compat: set to 4

    but not closing, #21987)

  * Changed home_ftp explanation to check for an ftp user in
    /etc/passwd, and to do nothing if no ftp directory was found (thanks
    to David Frey for /etc/passwd bit) (Closes #24339)

  * Fix bashism (avoid ash bug?) in cruft ([ ""$FOO = "" ] doesn't
    work as expected) (Closes #28593)

cruft (0.9.4.1) unstable; urgency=low

    one left around from some prior build.

cruft (0.9.4) unstable; urgency=low

cruft (0.9.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved cruft.extrafiles dpkg control file to /usr/lib/cruft/filters
    in preparation of actually uploading to unstable.
  * Added need_* and want_* files: for things that *have* to be there,
    but aren't particularly provided by anthing. Used for dealing with
    symlinks (need_symlink_dest), and alternatives (/usr/bin/vi, rather
    than /etc/alternatives/vi, eg).
  * Moved canonical into /usr/lib/cruft 
  * Added checks for broken symlinks 
  * Moved distributed filters from /etc/cruft/filters to 
    /usr/lib/cruft/filters
  * Added TODO file
